# Based on Ubuntu16(CPU only)

PS:The following installing way is based on Ubuntu16, which requires at least 2G memory, 10G storagy. Because there is a conflict between Caffe and Anaconda, it's better that insatll Caffe firstly and then install Anaconda.
But the installing strategy below is installing anaconda firstly. The cost is that I had to uninstall libtiff.

1.Download and install Anaconda2
wget -c https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda2-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
and so on.
add to environment variable.

2.Download Caffe
git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git

3.Install the attachments of Caffe
reference: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
click: Ubuntu installation the standard platform
Choose CMAKE strategy.
3.1 Install cmake and make
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install cmake
cmake --version   #must bigger than 2.8.7

3.2 Install atachments following Ubuntu (< 17.04)
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev

3.3 Install BLAS
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev

3.4 Install other attachments
sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev

3.5 Compilation
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
conda uninstall libtiff
make all
make install
make runtest

3.4 Final debugging
Add Caffe into environment variable:
export PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/caffe/python:$PYTHONPATH

$python
>>> import caffe
if there is error as following:
ImportError: No module named skimage.io
solution:
pip install scikit-image

if there is still error as following:
ImportError: No module named google.protobuf.internal
solution:
pip install protobuf

finally:
>>> import caffe
>>> exit()

if there is still error,solution:
sudo vi /etc/profile
export PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/caffe/python:$PYTHONPATH
source /etc/profile
source ~/.bashrc
