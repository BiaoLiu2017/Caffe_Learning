Caffe installing（RHEL  Fedora CentOS for GPU）

# 1. Install attachments
sudo yum install protobuf-devel leveldb-devel snappy-devel opencv-devel boost-devel hdf5-devel gflags-devel glog-devel lmdb-devel

# 2. Install cuda
CUDA: Install via the NVIDIA package instead of yum to be certain of the library and driver versions. 
Install the library and latest driver separately; the driver bundled with the library is usually out-of-date. 
+ CentOS/RHEL/Fedora: cuda had been installed.

# 3. Install BLAS
There are three blas you can choose, atlas，openblas and MKL. The difference is the speed on cpu is different.
I choose openblas:
sudo yum install openblas-devel.x86_64

# 4. Before compiling
cd caffe 
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config 
vim Makefile.config
Change the file into following:
# BLAS choice:
# atlas for ATLAS (default)
# mkl for MKL
# open for OpenBlas
#BLAS := atlas
BLAS := open

# Homebrew puts openblas in a directory that is not on the standard search path
# BLAS_INCLUDE := $(shell brew --prefix openblas)/include
# BLAS_LIB := $(shell brew --prefix openblas)/lib
BLAS_INCLUDE := /usr/include/openblas

# Uncomment to support layers written in Python (will link against Python libs)
WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1

# 5. compiling
make all -j8       #8 means using 8 cpu to run     
make test
make runtest

# 6. final debugging
## 6.1 get the pathway of numpy 
python
>>> import numpy
>>> numpy.get_include()
'/usr/local/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include'

## 6.2 vim Makefile.config
vim Makefile.config
from:
PYTHON_INCLUDE := /usr/include/python2.7 \
        /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include
into:
PYTHON_INCLUDE := /usr/include/python2.7 \
         /usr/local/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include

and in the root directory of caffe:
make pycaffe 

error:
ImportError: No module named google.protobuf.internal
solution:
sudo /usr/local/anaconda2/bin/pip install protobuf

finally:
make pycaffe 

# 7. make distribute
in the root directory of caffe:
make distribute

So, everyone can copy the caffe directory to his/her directory, and add caffe into environment variable.
cp -rf /home/one/caffe /home/two/
export PYTHONPATH="/home/two/caffe/python:$PYTHONPATH"

So, every can use Caffe!
